### Rules
To start with default settings (99 mines, 20 rows, 40 columns), hit 'Start Game' button.  Click anywhere in the grid.  If you click a mine, the game will end and prompt you to restart.  Otherwise, it will become a number telling you the number of mines surrounding that square.  You can right-click to place a flag on items you think will be mines.

Once you have clicked every square that is not a mine, you win!
